How do I get it working?
â€¢ Add a Ring device  

When adding your first device, you will need to log in with your Ring account. Any subsequent devices will be added using the previous login session.  

Two-step verification is required. You must enable this in your Ring account!  

**Note:** The Ring Contact Sensor requires a Ring Alarm system.
