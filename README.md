# Connect your Ring Doorbell, Camera, and Alarm products with Homey.  

Integrating Ring devices with Homey unlocks seamless control and automation for your smart home. With support for Ring Doorbells, Cameras, and Alarm systems, you can enhance your home's security and convenience by centralizing device management within the Homey ecosystem. Here's what you can do:

- Doorbell Notifications: Receive instant alerts when someone rings your Ring Doorbell and send a snapshot from your Doorbell.
- Camera Monitoring: Use motion detection events to trigger automations, such as turning on lights or sending notifications, including snapshots
- Alarm Integration: Arm or disarm your Ring Alarm system from Homey and link it to other devices, like locking doors or activating sirens when a threat is detected.
- Custom Automations: Create powerful flows using Homey's Flow feature. For example, automatically turn on outdoor lights when motion is detected by your Ring Camera or Ring Outdoor Motion Detector after sunset.

With Ring and Homey working together, you can build a smarter, more responsive home that keeps you informed and in control wherever you are.
